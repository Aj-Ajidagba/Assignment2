			<h3><strong>About Me</strong></h3>
			<h4>My name is Anjolaoluwa Marcus Ajidagba. I am 19 years old. I was born on the 16th of June. I am from Ogun State but I live in Lagos State. I belong to a family of 5. I attend Covenant University, where I am currently studying Mechanical Engineering and in my 3rd year. My favourite colour is green. I enjoy playing soccer, reading motivational books and listening to music. I want to be an engineer, an entrepreneur, a philantropist and a World leader.</h4>

			<h4>1. MY TESTIMONY</h4>
			<p>
			<h5>
				For the past 16 years of my life, I have lived, without knowing the God I served.
				On the 17th of April, it all changed.
				I woke up early and 'was tired like 'normally am. Little did I know that I was going to encounter God that day.
				Reminiscing the events of that day, before the glorious rendezvous.
				I smile and I'm flabbergasted by the awesomeness of the God I serve.
				On that day the Holy Spirit came upon me through the song of one of God's greatest music ministers--Nathaniel Bassey.
				The name of the song: "Book of Life."
				Never before have I heard a song with so much meaning and power on a Sunday evening; on that day, that evening God liberated me from sin, after I had listened to the song a million times.
				But before the covenant could be sealed, God demanded I forgave myself; and desist from condemning myself.
				At that point in time the task was the hardest thing any teenage boy corrupted by the immorality of the World, he found himself in could do.
				Then and there, I realized I had been dealing with God all along; not with flesh; not with the devil; but with God Almighty.

			<h4>2. THE REVOLUTION/REVELATION</h4>
			<p>
			<h5>
			
				There are 66 BOOKS in the BIBLE but coincidentally out of the FEW number of books of the bible I've finished, GENESIS and REVELATION seem to have had the MOST IMPACT on ME.
				In these two BIBLE BOOKS I discovered a hidden message at the ALPHA and the OMEGA. The message goes as follows:
				"
				1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. - Gen. 1:1
				26 So Joseph died at the age of 110. The Egyptians embalmed him, and his body was placed in a coffin in Egypt. - Gen. 50:26
				1 This is a revelation froma Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show his servants the events that must soonb take place. He sent an angel to present this revelation to his servant John, - Rev. 1:1
				21 May the grace of the Lord Jesus be with Godâ€™s holy people.f   - Rev. 22:21
				"
				The End. So DID YOU GET THE MESSAGE?
